Sign-In with Cardano (SIWC) is a form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their Cardano account instead of relying on a traditional intermediary such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter or other web 2 social apps. SIWC effort standardizes the authentication method with best practices by implementing the oAuth 2.0 protocol and making use of web3 resources, in our case wallets and message signature.
